IN THIS PROJECT, I HAVE DESIGNED A BASIC ARITHMETIC LOGIC UNIT (ALU) USING VERILOG HARDWARE DESCRIPTION LANGUAGE. AN ALU IS A DIGITAL CIRCUIT WHICH PERFORMS ARITHMETIC AND LOGICAL OPERATIONS IN A COMPUTER SYSTEM. I HAVE INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING OPERATIONS IN THE ALU DESIGN:

ADDITION

SUBTRACTION

BITWISE AND

BITWISE OR

BITWISE NOT (ONLY ON INPUT A)

THE ALU TAKES TWO 4-BIT INPUTS NAMED A AND B. IT ALSO TAKES A 3-BIT SELECT SIGNAL (CALLED SEL), WHICH DECIDES WHICH OPERATION TO PERFORM. DEPENDING ON THE VALUE OF SEL, A DIFFERENT OUTPUT IS PRODUCED ON THE RESULT LINE. THE OUTPUT IS ALSO A 4-BIT VALUE.

I HAVE ALSO WRITTEN A TESTBENCH TO VERIFY THE WORKING OF THE ALU DESIGN. IN THE TESTBENCH, I HAVE GIVEN DIFFERENT VALUES FOR A, B, AND SEL, AND THEN DISPLAYED THE OUTPUT RESULT FOR EACH OPERATION. I USED DELAY STATEMENTS (#10) AFTER EACH INPUT CHANGE TO GIVE TIME FOR THE OUTPUT TO STABILIZE.

TOOLS USED:

FOR CODING, I USED VERILOG LANGUAGE WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON HARDWARE DESCRIPTION LANGUAGES USED TO DESIGN DIGITAL CIRCUITS.

FOR SIMULATION, I USED ICARUS VERILOG TO COMPILE THE CODE AND GTKWave TO VIEW THE OUTPUT WAVEFORMS. ICARUS VERILOG IS AN OPEN SOURCE VERILOG SIMULATOR, AND GTKWave IS USED TO VISUALIZE THE WAVEFORMS OF THE SIGNALS.

IF THESE TOOLS ARE NOT AVAILABLE, THE SAME CODE CAN ALSO BE RUN ON ONLINE PLATFORMS SUCH AS EDA PLAYGROUND, WHICH PROVIDES A WEB-BASED SIMULATOR FOR VERILOG AND SYSTEMVERILOG CODES.

EDITOR PLATFORM USED:

I USED A SIMPLE TEXT EDITOR LIKE NOTEPAD++ TO WRITE THE CODE. I SAVED THE FILES WITH .v EXTENSION. THEN I USED THE TERMINAL TO COMPILE AND RUN THEM USING ICARUS VERILOG COMMANDS. FOR VIEWING THE OUTPUT GRAPHICALLY, I USED GTKWave WHICH OPENS THE .vcd FILE GENERATED DURING SIMULATION.

APPLICATIONS OF THIS TASK:

THIS PROJECT IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE ALU IS A CORE COMPONENT OF ANY PROCESSOR OR MICROCONTROLLER. WITHOUT AN ALU, A COMPUTER CANNOT PERFORM BASIC OPERATIONS LIKE ADDING OR COMPARING NUMBERS. THIS SIMPLE ALU DESIGN IS LIKE A MINIATURE VERSION OF THE ACTUAL ALU FOUND IN A REAL CPU.

THIS TASK CAN BE USED IN:

LEARNING DIGITAL ELECTRONICS CONCEPTS

UNDERSTANDING HOW PROCESSORS PERFORM OPERATIONS

PROJECTS RELATED TO COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE

LAB EXPERIMENTS FOR VLSI, VERILOG, OR EMBEDDED SYSTEM COURSES
